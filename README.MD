# Definitely, not Centipede

### About the project

Hello, this is my first attempt to use the p5js library. I was inspired by the game centipede and tried to make a clone using just native javascript and the p5js library. I ran into a bunch of problems but it was a helpful and good learning experience. I hope some of this code can inspire someone else. I've put links below for the libraries that I used.

Since this was my first attemp using p5js I was little unsure of the structure I wanted to use, so there maybe some un-used code laying around.

### Libraries Used

* [P5js](https://p5js.org/)
* [Bmoren's Collision Library](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D)
